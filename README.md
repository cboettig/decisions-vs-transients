## ESA 2019 Slides

An early version of this research was presented at ESA 2019 in the organized oral session, [Transients in Ecology](https://eco.confex.com/eco/2019/meetingapp.cgi/Session/15321).  Slides for that talk have moved to a separate repo and can now be found at <https://cboettig.github.io/talks-2019-esa>.  

## Notebook

All scripts, notes etc related to this work are collected in the [notebook](notebook/) directory as RMarkdown notebooks (and in the version history of this repo).  

## Acknowledgements

This work was inspired in part by participation in a [NIMBioS workshop on transient dynamics](http://www.nimbios.org/workshops/WS_transients).
